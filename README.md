# Language Specification of CIT’s First Programming Language (CFPL)

## Introduction
CFPL is a very simple programming language that allows the programmer to achieve fluency in minutes. It is a strongly typed programming language. It is intended for students enrolled in programming languages. It aims to train them on how to build a pure interpreter.

Sample Program:

    * my first program in CFPL
    VAR abc, b, c AS INT
    VAR x, w_23='w' AS CHAR
    VAR t="TRUE" AS BOOL
    START
      abc=b=10
      w_23=’a’
      * this is a comment
      OUTPUT: abc & “hi” & b & “#” & w_23 & “[#]”
    STOP

Output of the sample program:

    10hi10
    a#

## Language Grammar

### Program Structure:
  - every line contains a single statement
  - all variable declaration is found on top of the program
  - a line that starts with asterisk(*) is considered as a comment and comment can be found in any part of the program
  - executable code should be found inside the START and STOP block - all reserved words are in capital letters
  - sharp sign(#) signifies next line or carriage return
  - ampersand(&) serves as a concatenator
  - the square braces([]) are as escape code

### Data Types:
    INT – an ordinary number with no decimal part. It uses 32 bits. It can be positive or negative. (default: 0)
    CHAR – a single symbol. It uses UNICODE. (default:"")
    BOOL – represents the literals "TRUE" or "FALSE". (default: "FALSE")
    FLOAT – a number with decimal part. It uses 64 bits. (default: 0)

### Operators:

#### Arithmetic operators

    ( )         - parenthesis
    *, /, %     - multiplication, division, modulo
    +, -        - addition, subtraction
    >, <        - greater than, lesser than
    >=, <=      - greater than or equal to, lesser than or equal to
    ==, <>      - equal, not equal

#### Logical operators (<BOOL expression><LogicalOperator><BOOL expression>)
  
    AND         - needs the two BOOL expression to be true to result to true, else false
    OR          - if one of the BOOL expressions evaluates to true, returns true, else false
    NOT         - the reverse value of the BOOL value (NOT <BOOL expression>)
  
#### Unary operator

    +           - positive
    -           - negative

### Sample Programs
  1. A program with arithmetic operation
  
    VAR xyz, abc=100 AS INT
    START
      xyz= ((abc *5)/10 + 10) * -1
      * xyz should have the value -60
      OUTPUT: "[[]" & xyz & "[]]"
    STOP
    
  Output of the sample program:
  
    [-60]

  2. A program with logical operation
  
    VAR a=100, b=200, c=300 AS INT
    VAR d="FALSE" AS BOOL
    START
      d = (a < b AND c <>200)
      OUTPUT: d
    STOP

  Output of the sample program:

    TRUE


##### CFPL Control structures allows programmers to develop codes that will support commands with decision making capabilities.

  1. Control structures
  a. If statement
  
    - IF (<BOOL expression>)
        START
          <statement>
          ...
          <statement>
        STOP
  
  b. If-else statement
  
    - IF (<BOOL expression>)
        START
          <statement>
          ...
          <statement>
        STOP
    - ELSE
        START
          <statement>
          ...
          <statement>
        STOP
  c. While statement

    - WHILE (<BOOL expression>)
        START
          <statement>
          ...
          <statement>
        STOP

  2. INPUT – allow the user to input a value to a data type.
  Syntax:

    INPUT: <variableName>[,<variableName>]*

  Sample use:

    INPUT: x, y

  - means in the screen you have to input two values separated by comma(,)
